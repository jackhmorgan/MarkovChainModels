# Markov Chain models
Repository of the code used for the calculations in Quantum Computational Algorithms for Derivative Pricing and Credit Risk in a Regime Switching Economy by Ghysels, Morgan, and Mohammadbagherpoor available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00825.

Portions of the markov_chain_models directory are copied from qiskit_algorithms 0.3.0, which has since been depricated. The files which are copied have been denoted so at the top of the file.

The example_nb notebook walks through a the usage of this repository.
